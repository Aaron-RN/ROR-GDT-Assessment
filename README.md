## Built With

- Ruby - '2.6.3'

- RSpec-rails '~> 4.0.0'

### Automated Testing with [RSPEC](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)

* Run `bundle exe rspec` within the terminal console after installing project repository.

## Setting up your own Back-End

### Installation

* Download repository to your local machine, then run `bundle install` and run `rails db:setup`, `rails db:migrate` all within the terminal console.

### Navigate to config/initializers directory

1. Enter the cors.rb file and...
2. On line 10 you will replace ```origins 'https://arn-gdt-assessment.netlify.app'``` with your own custom app's url. *(As you can see I used heroku to host my app)*
3. Close the cors.rb file and...
4. Open the session_store.rb file within the same config/initializers directory and...
5. Similar to what you did in the cors.rb file, on line 5 you will replace ```domain: 'arn-gdt-assessment-api.herokuapp.com'``` with your own custom app's domain.
